# Mental Health Data Science Project

Creators: Kadi Tulver, Rauno Tali, TÃµnn Sikk

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, data files, and reports for a Tartu University data science course project focused on mental health analysis using the DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) dataset. The project is structured into several sections, each dedicated to different aspects of data science workflows, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model training for different types of predictions.

## Repository Structure

### Notebooks
- `Data exploration and descriptives.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics of the dataset.
- `Dataset cleaning and preparation.ipynb`: Data preprocessing steps and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- `DASS dataset pre-validation.ipynb`: Pre-validation procedures for the DASS dataset.

### Models
- `/Binary Classification`: Jupyter notebooks related to binary classification model experiments and trainings.
- `/Category classification models`: Notebooks for categorical outcome prediction models.
- `/Linear models`: Notebooks containing linear modeling for continuous outcome predictions.

### Data
- `/DASS dataset`: Contains the `filtered_data_newfeatures.csv` file which is the cleaned and preprocessed version of the DASS dataset used for the analyses.

### Reports
- `HW08_report.pdf`: A early stage report describing the planned methodology, analysis steps, and resource distribution.
- `Mental health data science - project report.pdf`: The final project report, describing the all the preprocessing steps and data analyses, as well as background.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or use the models, clone this repository and follow the notebooks in sequence starting from data cleaning to exploratory analysis and then model training. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed as indicated in the notebooks.
